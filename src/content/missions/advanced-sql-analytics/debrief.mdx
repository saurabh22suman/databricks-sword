# MISSION DEBRIEF: Operation Query Blade

**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## RESULTS SUMMARY

You've transformed StreamVerse's SQL analytics from 20-minute queries to sub-second performance:

### What You Accomplished

- **Mastered CTEs** — Replaced nested subqueries with readable, chainable WITH clauses
- **Leveraged window functions** — Rankings, running totals, lag/lead comparisons
- **Created materialized views** — Pre-computed aggregations for hot dashboard queries
- **Optimized execution** — EXPLAIN plans, predicate pushdown, Z-ORDER indexing

### Key Concepts Locked In

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| CTEs (WITH clause) | Named temporary result sets for readable, composable queries |
| ROW_NUMBER() / RANK() | Row ordering within partitions |
| LAG() / LEAD() | Compare current row to previous/next rows |
| NTILE() | Distribute rows into equal-sized buckets |
| MATERIALIZED VIEW | Pre-computed, auto-refreshed query results |
| EXPLAIN | Reveals query execution plan for optimization |
| Z-ORDER | Multi-column co-location for faster filtering |
| ANALYZE TABLE | Collects statistics for the query optimizer |

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Before:** 20-minute query times, nested subquery spaghetti, full table scans
**After:** Sub-second dashboards, readable CTEs, materialized views, optimized plans

*"Our content team went from waiting 20 minutes for viewer trends to getting them in under a second. That's not optimization — that's a paradigm shift."*
