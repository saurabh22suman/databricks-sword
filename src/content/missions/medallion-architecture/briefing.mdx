# Mission Briefing: Medallion Architecture

## Situation Report

**Client:** StreamVerse Media — a streaming platform with 80M subscribers generating 2TB of event data daily across clicks, views, pauses, skips, and subscriptions. Their data lake is a "data swamp" — raw files mixed with partially processed tables, no clear lineage, and analysts waste hours finding the right data.

## Your Mission

Design and implement a full medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) using Delta Live Tables. Transform StreamVerse's chaotic data lake into a structured, reliable, and performant lakehouse.

## Objectives

1. **Design the Bronze layer** — raw data ingestion with schema enforcement
2. **Build the Silver layer** — cleaned, deduplicated, enriched data
3. **Create the Gold layer** — business-level aggregations and feature tables
4. **Implement CDC patterns** — handle updates and deletes across layers
5. **Compare medallion approaches** — when to use streaming vs batch per layer

## Key Intelligence

- **Bronze (Raw)**: Append-only, schema-on-read, preserves raw data exactly as received
- **Silver (Validated)**: Cleaned, deduplicated, conformed schema, business keys resolved
- **Gold (Business)**: Aggregated, feature-engineered, optimized for specific use cases
- DLT automates dependency resolution between layers
- CDC (Change Data Capture) propagates updates through the medallion layers

## Stakes

StreamVerse's analysts currently spend 60% of their time finding and cleaning data instead of analyzing it. A well-designed medallion architecture will reclaim 500+ analyst-hours per month.
