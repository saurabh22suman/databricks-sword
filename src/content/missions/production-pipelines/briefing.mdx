# Mission Briefing: Production Pipelines

## Situation Report

**Client:** MegaMart Global — an e-commerce giant processing 5M orders daily across 30 countries. They've prototyped their data pipelines in notebooks, but promoting to production keeps failing: inconsistent environments, no error handling, and zero monitoring.

## Your Mission

Transform MegaMart's prototype pipelines into production-grade systems using Delta Live Tables. Implement CDC for order updates, comprehensive error handling, automated monitoring, and SLA guarantees.

## Objectives

1. **Production DLT patterns** — parameterized pipelines, environment promotion
2. **CDC implementation** — APPLY CHANGES for order status tracking
3. **Error handling** — dead letter queues, retry logic, graceful degradation
4. **Pipeline monitoring** — DLT event logs, custom metrics, alerting
5. **SLA management** — latency tracking, freshness monitoring, incident response

## Key Intelligence

- DLT pipelines should be parameterized for dev/staging/prod environments
- APPLY CHANGES INTO handles CDC with automatic ordering by sequence column
- Dead letter queues capture records that fail processing without blocking the pipeline
- DLT event logs provide built-in monitoring (pipeline start/stop, quality metrics, errors)
- SLA monitoring tracks data freshness — how old is the latest data in Gold tables

## Stakes

MegaMart loses $50K per hour when data pipelines fail. Every missed SLA means incorrect pricing, delayed fraud detection, or wrong inventory counts. Production reliability is not optional.
