      "id": "q1",
      "question": "What is the main advantage of Auto Loader over manual file processing scripts?",
      "options": [
        "Incremental processing - only processes new files since last run",
        "Faster file reading speed",
        "Better data compression",
        "Automatic data validation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Incremental processing - only processes new files since last run",
      "explanation": "Auto Loader tracks which files have been processed and only loads new files, making it highly efficient for continuous ingestion. Manual scripts typically re-scan entire directories."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "What does schema inference do in Auto Loader?",
      "options": [
        "Automatically detects column names and data types from sample files",
        "Validates data quality",
        "Compresses data files",
        "Encrypts sensitive columns"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Automatically detects column names and data types from sample files",
      "explanation": "Schema inference analyzes a sample of files to automatically determine the schema (column names and types), eliminating the need to manually define schemas for JSON/CSV files."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What happens when Auto Loader encounters a new column in incoming data?",
      "options": [
        "With schemaEvolutionMode='addNewColumns', it automatically adds the column",
        "It throws an error and stops processing",
        "It ignores the new column",
        "It overwrites the existing schema"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "With schemaEvolutionMode='addNewColumns', it automatically adds the column",
      "explanation": "Schema evolution allows Auto Loader to adapt to schema changes. The 'addNewColumns' mode automatically adds new columns to the target table when they appear in source files."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "What is the purpose of a checkpoint location in Auto Loader?",
      "options": [
        "Stores processing state to enable exactly-once processing and recovery",
        "Backs up source files",
        "Encrypts data in transit",
        "Compresses checkpoint data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Stores processing state to enable exactly-once processing and recovery",
      "explanation": "The checkpoint location stores metadata about processed files and stream state. This enables Auto Loader to resume from where it left off after cluster restarts without reprocessing files."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question": "When should you use COPY INTO instead of Auto Loader?",
      "options": [
        "One-time historical loads or simple batch ingestion",
        "Real-time streaming data",
        "Complex data transformations",
        "Large files that don't fit in memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "One-time historical loads or simple batch ingestion",
      "explanation": "COPY INTO is ideal for one-time data migration or simple batch loads where you don't need ongoing incremental processing. Auto Loader is better for continuous, streaming ingestion."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "question": "What file format does Auto Loader use internally to track processed files?",
      "options": [
        "Delta Lake transaction log",
        "JSON metadata files",
        "CSV tracking files",
        "Parquet state files"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Delta Lake transaction log",
      "explanation": "Auto Loader leverages Delta Lake's transaction log to maintain exactly-once semantics and track which files have been processed, ensuring no duplicates or missing data."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "question": "What does the 'cloudFiles' format refer to in Auto Loader?",
      "options": [
        "Databricks' cloud-optimized file ingestion format",
        "A specific file extension",
        "A compression algorithm",
        "A cloud storage provider"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Databricks' cloud-optimized file ingestion format",
      "explanation": "The 'cloudFiles' format is Auto Loader's streaming source that's optimized for cloud object storage, providing incremental processing, schema inference, and exactly-once guarantees."

  "learnings": [
    "Auto Loader incrementally processes new files",
    "Schema enforcement catches data quality issues early",
    "Schema evolution handles changing source schemas",
    "Checkpointing enables exactly-once ingestion",
    "Rescue columns capture malformed records"
