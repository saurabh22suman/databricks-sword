# MISSION DEBRIEF: Operation Model Registry

**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## RESULTS SUMMARY

You've transformed QuantumRisk's chaotic ML workflow into a governed, reproducible system:

### What You Accomplished

- **Mapped MLflow architecture** — experiments → runs → registered models → aliases
- **Built the workflow** — Data prep → training → logging → registry → deployment
- **Implemented tracking code** — `mlflow.log_param()`, `mlflow.log_metric()`, `mlflow.register_model()`
- **Mastered model promotion** — Staging → Champion → Production with governance

### Key Concepts Locked In

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `mlflow.start_run()` | Creates a tracked experiment run |
| `mlflow.log_param()` | Records hyperparameters for reproducibility |
| `mlflow.log_metric()` | Tracks performance metrics across training |
| `mlflow.log_artifact()` | Saves plots, configs, and custom files |
| `mlflow.register_model()` | Promotes a run's model to the registry |
| Model Aliases | Labels (Champion, Challenger) for deployment routing |
| `mlflow.search_runs()` | Queries runs for comparison and analysis |

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Before:** Models deployed via Slack, no tracking, $2.3M loss from stale data
**After:** Every experiment tracked, models governed through registry, full audit trail

### QuantumRisk's New ML Workflow

```
Data Scientist trains model → MLflow logs everything automatically
→ Best model registered in Model Registry
→ Staged for validation (A/B test against Champion)
→ Promoted to Production with approval
→ Full lineage for regulatory audit
```

## SKILLS ACQUIRED

- **MLflow Experiment API** — Organizing, logging, and querying experiments
- **Model Registry** — Versioning, aliasing, and lifecycle management
- **Reproducibility** — Any model can be recreated from its logged parameters and data version
- **Governance** — Audit trails and approval workflows for model promotion

---

*"Now every model has a story — from the data it learned from to the decision it was promoted for. That's not just engineering. That's accountability."*
