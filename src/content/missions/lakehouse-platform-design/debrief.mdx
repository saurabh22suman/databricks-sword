# Mission Debrief: Lakehouse Platform Design

## Mission Complete — Grandmaster Achievement Unlocked

You've designed NexaCorp's enterprise Lakehouse platform. This capstone brings together every skill from your journey — from DataFrame basics to production systems architecture.

## What You Learned

### Workspace Topology
- **Hub-and-spoke model** — central platform workspace + domain workspaces per business unit
- **Environment separation** — dev/staging/prod as separate workspaces (not just job parameters)
- **Shared services workspace** — for cross-cutting concerns (monitoring, governance, shared libraries)

### Unity Catalog Enterprise Design
- **One metastore per region** — governs all workspaces in that cloud region
- **Catalog-per-domain** — finance, supply_chain, marketing, etc.
- **Schema naming convention** — `{domain}.{layer}_{dataset}` (e.g., finance.silver_transactions)
- **Central governance team** — manages metastore, policies, and cross-domain access

### Data Mesh with Medallion
- **Platform-managed Bronze** — centralized ingestion team handles raw data
- **Domain-owned Silver/Gold** — each team curates their own domain data
- **Data products** — well-defined, discoverable, and governed Gold tables for consumption
- **Delta Sharing** — secure cross-organization data sharing without copying data

### Cost Management
- **Cluster policies** — restrict instance types, max workers, auto-terminate timeouts
- **Budgets** — per-workspace and per-team spending limits
- **Chargeback** — tag resources by team/project for cost allocation
- **Serverless SQL** — for ad-hoc queries (pay-per-query, no idle costs)

### Security Architecture
- **Network isolation** — private link, VNet injection, IP access lists
- **Encryption** — customer-managed keys for data at rest
- **Audit logging** — Unity Catalog audit logs to SIEM systems
- **Service principals** — non-human identities for automated pipelines

### Disaster Recovery
- **Multi-region failover** — replicate Delta tables across regions
- **Backup strategies** — DEEP CLONE for critical tables, daily snapshots
- **Recovery procedures** — documented runbooks, tested quarterly
- **RPO/RTO targets** — Recovery Point Objective < 1 hour, Recovery Time Objective < 4 hours

## Key Takeaways

1. Design for 10x growth — today's architecture should handle 10x data and 10x users
2. Governance is not optional — start with Unity Catalog from day one
3. Data mesh + medallion is the modern pattern — centralize infrastructure, decentralize data ownership
4. Cost management prevents cloud sprawl — set cluster policies and budgets immediately
5. Disaster recovery must be tested, not just documented

## The Journey Complete

You've mastered the complete Databricks ecosystem. From your first Delta table to designing enterprise platforms, you've built the skills to architect, build, and operate production data systems at any scale.

Welcome to the rank of **Grandmaster**.
