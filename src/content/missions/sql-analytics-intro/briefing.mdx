# Mission Briefing: SQL Analytics Intro

## The Situation

TechCorp's lakehouse is live, and the executive team is impressed. Now Marketing wants access.

The CMO hired **3 new business analysts** to build dashboards, but they only know SQL (no Python/Spark experience). They need to query the lakehouse, but traditional SQL tools can't connect to Delta Lake.

The data team tried giving them Databricks Notebooks, but:
- **Notebooks feel like coding** (analysts want a query editor)
- **Cluster management is confusing** (start/stop, instance types, autoscaling)
- **Costs are unpredictable** ($2,400 last week because someone left a cluster running overnight!)

The VP of Analytics wants a **SQL-native** experience with **serverless compute** — no cluster management, just write queries and get results.

## The Opportunity

**Databricks SQL Warehouses** (formerly SQL Endpoints) provide:
- **Serverless SQL engine** — instant-on, auto-scaling, no cluster config
- **BI tool integration** — Connect Tableau, Power BI, Looker directly
- **Query editor** — Familiar SQL interface (like any other database)
- **Cost optimization** — Pay per query, automatic shutdown, photon acceleration

Industry adoption for SQL analysts on lakehouses:
- **JetBlue:** 200+ analysts run 50K SQL queries/month on Delta Lake
- **Zillow:** Real estate analysts query 300TB lakehouse via SQL Warehouse
- **Conde Nast:** Editorial teams run ad-hoc SQL on 5B+ content events

## Your Mission

Build **SQL analytics queries** on the lakehouse using SQL Warehouses:

1. **Understand** SQL Warehouse architecture (clusters, endpoints, catalogs)
2. **Write** multi-table JOIN queries
3. **Aggregate** data with GROUP BY and window functions
4. **Create** views for reusable query logic
5. **Compare** SQL vs PySpark for different use cases

## Success Criteria

- **Working SQL queries** with JOINs and aggregations
- **View created** for customer metrics
- **Performance optimized** with proper JOIN order
- **Tradeoff understanding** (when SQL, when PySpark)

## The Stakes

If SQL Warehouses work, TechCorp can onboard **30+ analysts** to the lakehouse without teaching them Python. This enables:
- **Self-service analytics** (no more data engineer bottlenecks)
- **Faster insights** (analysts query directly, no ticket queue)
- **$180K/year savings** (replace 3 BI tool licenses)

This democratizes data access across the company.
