# MISSION DEBRIEF: Operation Neural Fortress

**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## RESULTS SUMMARY

You've built QuantumRisk's real-time fraud detection system — from feature engineering to production serving with full monitoring:

### What You Accomplished

- **Designed Feature Store tables** — Centralized features with online serving for real-time lookups
- **Deployed model serving endpoint** — Serverless, auto-scaling, sub-100ms inference
- **Implemented Champion/Challenger** — Safe model updates with traffic splitting and automated rollback
- **Set up drift monitoring** — Data drift detection, performance tracking, and alerting

### Key Concepts Locked In

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Feature Store | Centralized, governed feature management with online/offline serving |
| Online Tables | Low-latency feature lookups for real-time inference |
| Model Serving Endpoint | Serverless REST API for real-time predictions |
| Champion/Challenger | A/B testing pattern for safe model deployment |
| Traffic Routing | Percentage-based split between model versions |
| Data Drift | Statistical change in input feature distributions |
| Concept Drift | Change in the relationship between features and target |
| Monitoring Dashboard | Real-time tracking of model health metrics |

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Before:** 6-hour delay in fraud detection, batch scoring only, no monitoring
**After:** Sub-100ms real-time fraud detection, automated model updates, full drift monitoring

### QuantumRisk's Production ML Stack

```
Transactions → Feature Store (online lookup)
→ Model Serving Endpoint (Champion: 90%, Challenger: 10%)
→ Prediction: FRAUD / NOT FRAUD
→ Monitoring: drift detection, accuracy tracking
→ Alert if model degrades → Auto-retrain pipeline triggered
```

## ML TRACK COMPLETE

You've completed the entire ML track:
1. ✅ **ML Foundations** — Basic ML concepts and MLflow introduction
2. ✅ **MLflow Experiment Tracking** — Experiment management and model registry
3. ✅ **ML Pipelines in Production** — Full production ML lifecycle

You now have the skills to build, deploy, and monitor ML systems on Databricks at scale.
