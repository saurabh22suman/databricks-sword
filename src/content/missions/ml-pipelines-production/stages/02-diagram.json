    "Feature Store: Databricks Feature Store provides centralized feature tables with point-in-time lookups, ensuring training/serving consistency and eliminating training-serving skew.",
    "Model Training: MLflow Tracking logs experiments, parameters, metrics, and artifacts. AutoML and distributed training accelerate iteration cycles.",
    "Model Registry (Unity Catalog): Models are registered as UC assets with stage transitions (None → Staging → Production), lineage tracking, and access controls.",
    "Model Serving Endpoints: Serverless real-time endpoints with Champion/Challenger routing enable A/B testing and canary deployments with automatic scaling.",
    "Drift Monitoring: Lakehouse Monitoring tracks feature drift, prediction drift, and data quality. Alerts trigger retraining pipelines when metrics breach thresholds."
