# MISSION BRIEFING: Operation Neural Fortress

**OPERATIVE CLASSIFICATION:** S-Rank — ML Track (Capstone)

---

## SITUATION REPORT

**Client:** QuantumRisk Analytics — returning from your previous MLflow mission. They successfully implemented experiment tracking, and now the CEO wants real-time fraud detection.

**Crisis:** Their batch-scoring model catches fraud 6 hours after it happens. By then, fraudulent transactions have already cleared. The board demands real-time inference — sub-100ms predictions on every transaction, with automated model updates when fraud patterns shift.

**Your Mission:** Build the complete production ML pipeline: Feature Store for real-time features, model serving endpoint for inference, Champion/Challenger A/B testing, and drift monitoring to detect when the model degrades.

## INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING

### The Production ML Stack

Moving from notebook experimentation to production requires four critical systems:

**Feature Store** — Centralized feature management:
- Features computed once, shared across models and teams
- Point-in-time correctness prevents data leakage
- Online tables for real-time serving (sub-ms lookups)
- Unity Catalog integration for governance

**Model Serving** — Real-time inference endpoints:
- Serverless endpoints with auto-scaling (0 to 1000+ QPS)
- GPU support for deep learning models
- Custom preprocessing via MLflow PyFunc
- Traffic routing for A/B tests

**Champion/Challenger** — Safe model updates:
- Champion: Current production model (90% traffic)
- Challenger: New model being tested (10% traffic)
- Automated traffic shifting based on metric comparison
- Rollback if Challenger underperforms

**Drift Monitoring** — Model health surveillance:
- Data drift: Input feature distributions changing
- Concept drift: Relationship between features and target changing
- Performance monitoring: Real-time accuracy tracking
- Alerting: Slack/PagerDuty when thresholds breach

### Why This Matters

A model without monitoring is a ticking time bomb:
- Fraud patterns evolve — a model trained in January is stale by March
- Feature pipelines can break silently — garbage in, garbage out
- Without A/B testing, bad models go to 100% traffic instantly
- Regulatory requirements demand explainability and audit trails

## MISSION OBJECTIVES

1. **Map the production ML architecture** — Feature Store → Training → Serving → Monitoring
2. **Build the end-to-end pipeline** — From feature engineering to real-time serving
3. **Implement serving and monitoring code** — Endpoints, traffic routing, drift detection
4. **Validate mastery** — Prove you can design production ML systems
