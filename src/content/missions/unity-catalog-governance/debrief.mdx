# Mission Debrief: Unity Catalog & Governance

## Mission Complete

Federal DataVault now has a robust governance framework. Every dataset has clear ownership, auditable permissions, and automatic lineage tracking across all 15 departments.

## What You Learned

### Three-Level Namespace
- **Metastore** → **Catalog** → **Schema** → **Table/View** hierarchy
- Catalogs map to business domains (e.g., `finance`, `healthcare`, `operations`)
- Schemas map to projects or data stages (e.g., `raw`, `curated`, `analytics`)

### Access Control
- **GRANT/REVOKE** — SQL-based permission management
- **Privilege cascading** — permissions granted at catalog level flow to all children
- **Securable objects** — catalogs, schemas, tables, views, functions, volumes
- **Principals** — users, groups, service principals

### Fine-Grained Security
- **Dynamic views** — implement row-level security with `current_user()` and `is_member()`
- **Column masking** — hide sensitive columns based on group membership
- **Row filters** — restrict visible rows based on user attributes

### Data Lineage
- Unity Catalog automatically tracks table-to-table lineage
- Lineage captured from SQL, Python, and notebook operations
- Visual lineage explorer in the Databricks workspace

## Key SQL Commands Mastered
- `CREATE CATALOG`, `CREATE SCHEMA`
- `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ... TO ...`
- `REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ...`
- `SHOW GRANTS ON ...`
- `ALTER TABLE ... SET OWNER TO ...`

## Next Steps

Your governance skills unlock **Data Quality Framework** — where you'll build validation rules on top of this access control layer.
