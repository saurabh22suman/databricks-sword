# Mission Briefing: Unity Catalog & Governance

## Situation Report

**Client:** Federal DataVault — a government data agency managing 200+ datasets across 15 departments. Each department has different clearance levels, and audit compliance requires full lineage tracking for every data asset.

## Your Mission

Federal DataVault is migrating from legacy Hive metastores to Unity Catalog. You must design the governance framework: namespaces, access controls, and lineage tracking that satisfies both operational needs and audit requirements.

## Objectives

1. **Understand the three-level namespace** — catalog.schema.table hierarchy
2. **Configure fine-grained access** — GRANT/REVOKE permissions at every level
3. **Implement row and column-level security** — protect sensitive fields
4. **Track data lineage** — automated lineage from Unity Catalog
5. **Apply governance best practices** — least privilege, separation of duties

## Key Intelligence

- Unity Catalog provides centralized governance across all Databricks workspaces
- The three-level namespace: `catalog.schema.table` replaces the flat Hive model
- Permissions cascade down: granting on a catalog flows to all schemas and tables within
- Dynamic views enable row-level and column-level security
- Data lineage is automatically captured for tables, notebooks, and pipelines

## Stakes

Without proper governance, a data breach in a government system means regulatory fines, compromised citizen data, and public trust erosion. Every permission must be justified and auditable.
