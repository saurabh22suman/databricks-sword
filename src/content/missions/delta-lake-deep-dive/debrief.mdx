# Mission Complete: Delta Lake Deep Dive

## What You Accomplished

You mastered **Delta Lake internals** and production optimization techniques. MedData Health now has:

- **Time travel** for data recovery and auditing
- **Optimized tables** with 10x faster query performance
- **Z-ordered data** for efficient patient lookups
- **Automated VACUUM** for storage cost control
- **CDC pipelines** for real-time hospital data sync

## What You Learned

### Core Concepts
- **Transaction log:** JSON files tracking every change (the source of truth)
- **Time travel:** Query any historical version via VERSION AS OF or TIMESTAMP AS OF
- **OPTIMIZE:** Compacts small files into larger ones (target: 256MB-1GB)
- **Z-ORDER:** Co-locates data by specified columns for faster filtering
- **VACUUM:** Removes files older than retention period (default 7 days)
- **CDC:** Change Data Feed captures row-level INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations

### Best Practices
- Run OPTIMIZE on tables with frequent small writes (streaming bronze tables)
- Z-ORDER by columns used in WHERE clauses (e.g., patient_id, date)
- Set VACUUM retention > streaming checkpoint age to avoid data loss
- Enable Change Data Feed for tables needing incremental downstream processing
