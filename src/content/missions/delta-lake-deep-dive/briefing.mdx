# Mission Briefing: Delta Lake Deep Dive

## The Situation

**MedData Health**, a nationwide hospital network, stores **500TB of patient records** in Delta Lake. Compliance requires 7-year data retention with full audit trails.

The problems:
- **Query performance degraded** after 6 months (small files, no optimization)
- **Accidental deletions** happened twice — no easy recovery
- **Storage costs rising** (old versions never cleaned up)
- **CDC feeds** from 200 hospital systems need real-time sync

They need **Delta Lake power features** to manage this data at scale.

## Your Mission

1. **Time travel:** Restore accidentally deleted records using versioning
2. **OPTIMIZE:** Compact small files for better query performance
3. **Z-ORDER:** Co-locate related data for faster scans
4. **VACUUM:** Clean old file versions to reduce storage costs
5. **Change Data Capture:** Stream incremental changes from source systems
