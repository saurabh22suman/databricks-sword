      "question": "What is Photon in Databricks?",
      "options": [
        "A visualization library",
        "A next-generation vectorized query engine written in C++ for faster SQL and DataFrame execution",
        "A storage format",
        "A monitoring tool"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Photon is Databricks' native vectorized execution engine. Written in C++ (not JVM-based), it processes data in batches using SIMD instructions, achieving significant speedups for SQL and DataFrame workloads—often 2-8x faster than standard Spark."
    },
    {
      "id": "photon-2",
      "question": "What does 'vectorized execution' mean in the context of query engines?",
      "options": [
        "Processing one row at a time",
        "Processing batches of rows together using CPU vector instructions (SIMD)",
        "Storing data as vectors",
        "Parallel network requests"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Vectorized execution processes data in column batches (typically 1000+ rows) rather than row-by-row. Modern CPUs can apply the same operation to multiple values simultaneously (SIMD), dramatically improving throughput for analytical queries."
    },
    {
      "id": "photon-3",
      "question": "Which workloads benefit most from Photon acceleration?",
      "options": [
        "Machine learning training",
        "SQL analytics, aggregations, joins, and data transformations on structured data",
        "Image processing",
        "Network operations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Photon accelerates SQL and DataFrame operations: scans, filters, aggregations, joins, and window functions. It's especially effective for data warehousing workloads on Delta Lake tables. ML training still uses standard Spark or ML libraries."
    },
    {
      "id": "photon-4",
      "question": "How do you enable Photon on a Databricks cluster?",
      "options": [
        "It requires a code change",
        "Select a Photon-enabled cluster type or toggle Photon acceleration in cluster config",
        "Install a separate package",
        "It's only available via API"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Photon is enabled at the cluster level. When creating or editing a cluster, select a Photon Runtime or enable the Photon acceleration toggle. No code changes are needed—your existing SQL and DataFrames automatically use Photon where applicable."
    },
    {
      "id": "photon-5",
      "question": "Why is Photon written in C++ rather than running on the JVM like Spark?",
      "options": [
        "C++ is easier to write",
        "Native C++ code avoids JVM overhead, enables direct memory management, and leverages CPU instructions efficiently",
        "Java doesn't support databases",
        "It was a random choice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "C++ allows Photon to manage memory directly (no garbage collection pauses), use SIMD instructions explicitly, and minimize per-row overhead. The JVM adds abstraction layers that, while convenient, can limit performance for tight compute loops."
