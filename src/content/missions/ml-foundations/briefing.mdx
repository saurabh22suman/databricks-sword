# Mission Briefing: ML Foundations

## The Situation

You've just joined **QuantFin Capital**, a quantitative hedge fund managing $2.3B in assets. The ML team has a problem: **experiment chaos.**

Over the past 6 months, the team has trained **427 different models** for credit risk prediction, each with different hyperparameters, feature sets, and evaluation metrics. But there's no central tracking system.

When asked "Which model performed best last month?", it takes **3 days** of manual log diving to answer. When a model gets deployed to production, **nobody knows which hyperparameters were used.** Reproducibility is impossible.

## The Opportunity

The lead ML engineer discovered **MLflow** — an open-source platform for managing the ML lifecycle. It can track:
- **Experiments** — Group related training runs
- **Parameters** — Hyperparameters like learning rate, model rank
- **Metrics** — Accuracy, RMSE, training time
- **Artifacts** — Trained models, plots, data samples

Your team needs someone to **prove the concept** before rolling it out company-wide.

## Your Mission

Build a **recommendation model** with **full MLflow experiment tracking**:

1. **Load** synthetic user-item rating data
2. **Track experiments** using MLflow (parameters, metrics, artifacts)
3. **Train** an ALS model to predict ratings
4. **Log results** for reproducibility and comparison
5. **Visualize** metrics across multiple runs

## Success Criteria

- **All runs logged** with parameters, metrics, and model artifacts
- **RMSE < 1.0** on test data
- **Experiment UI** shows clear comparison of hyperparameter effects
- **Model reproducible** from logged artifacts

## The Stakes

If MLflow works for this pilot, QuantFin will adopt it for all 23 ML models in production. This would save **40 hours/month** of debugging time and prevent costly production bugs from untracked experiments.

This is your chance to establish **ML engineering best practices** from day one.
