      "question": "What is the primary purpose of Delta Lake's transaction log (_delta_log)?",
      "options": [
        "Store the actual data files",
        "Track every change made to the table for ACID guarantees",
        "Cache query results for faster reads",
        "Store user authentication information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The _delta_log directory contains JSON files that track every transaction (write, update, delete) made to the table. This is the foundation of Delta Lake's ACID compliance and time travel capabilities."
    },
    {
      "id": "delta-oss-2",
      "question": "What open-source file format does Delta Lake use to store the actual data?",
      "options": [
        "Avro",
        "ORC",
        "Parquet",
        "CSV"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Delta Lake uses Parquet as its underlying data format. Parquet is a columnar storage format optimized for analytics workloads with excellent compression and encoding support."
    },
    {
      "id": "delta-oss-3",
      "question": "What happens when a checkpoint file is created in the transaction log?",
      "options": [
        "All data files are backed up",
        "A snapshot of the table state is saved in Parquet format for faster reads",
        "The table is locked for maintenance",
        "Old data is permanently deleted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Checkpoints are created periodically (default: every 10 commits) to consolidate the transaction log into a single Parquet file. This enables faster table state reconstruction without reading all JSON log files."
    },
    {
      "id": "delta-oss-4",
      "question": "Which feature allows Delta Lake to 'undo' a bad write by reading a previous table version?",
      "options": [
        "VACUUM",
        "OPTIMIZE",
        "Time Travel",
        "Z-ORDER"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Time Travel leverages the transaction log to reconstruct any previous table state. You can query historical data using VERSION AS OF or TIMESTAMP AS OF syntax, or RESTORE a table to a prior version."
    },
    {
      "id": "delta-oss-5",
      "question": "Delta Lake was originally created at which company before becoming open-source?",
      "options": [
        "Google",
        "AWS",
        "Databricks",
        "Netflix"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Delta Lake was created by Databricks and open-sourced in 2019. It was accepted into the Linux Foundation in 2021, making it a vendor-neutral open standard for lakehouse storage."
