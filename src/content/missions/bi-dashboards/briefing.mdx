# MISSION BRIEFING: Operation Glass Dashboard

**OPERATIVE CLASSIFICATION:** A-Rank — BI Track

---

## SITUATION REPORT

**Client:** NovaMart — a national retail chain with 800 stores, 12,000 SKUs, and $4.2B annual revenue.

**Crisis:** Their BI team uses legacy Tableau/Power BI dashboards connected to a data warehouse that's 6 hours stale. Store managers make inventory decisions on yesterday's data. The VP of Analytics wants real-time dashboards directly on the Lakehouse — no data copies, no ETL delays. They also need self-service analytics with parameterized views so each regional manager sees only their region's data.

**Your Mission:** Build a production BI dashboard system using Databricks SQL: configure SQL Warehouses for optimal cost/performance, create Lakeview dashboards with parameters, set up alerts for KPI breaches, and schedule automated refreshes.

## INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING

### Databricks BI Stack

**SQL Warehouses** are the compute layer for BI:
- **Serverless SQL Warehouse:** Instant startup, pay-per-query, best for ad-hoc
- **Pro SQL Warehouse:** Dedicated endpoints, predictive caching, best for dashboards
- **Classic SQL Warehouse:** Legacy, being deprecated

**Lakeview Dashboards** are Databricks-native:
- Drag-and-drop visualization builder
- SQL-backed — every chart is a SQL query
- Parameters for interactivity (date range, region, category)
- Sharing via URL with row-level security via Unity Catalog
- Auto-refresh schedules (every 5min, hourly, daily)

**SQL Alerts** monitor your data:
- Run a query on a schedule
- Trigger when a condition is met (e.g., inventory < threshold)
- Notify via Slack, email, or webhook
- Pair with scheduled queries for automated reporting

### Why This Matters

- Dashboard directly on Lakehouse = no data copies, no staleness
- Parameters give self-service without separate dashboards per team
- Alerts turn passive dashboards into active monitoring
- SQL Warehouses with caching make dashboards feel instant

## MISSION OBJECTIVES

1. **Map the BI dashboard architecture** — SQL Warehouse → Queries → Dashboards → Alerts
2. **Build the dashboard workflow** — From data preparation to published dashboard
3. **Implement dashboard and alert configuration** — Parameters, visualizations, alerts
4. **Validate your knowledge** — Prove mastery of Databricks BI
