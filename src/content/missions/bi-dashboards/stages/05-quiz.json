      "question": "What is the key advantage of Serverless SQL Warehouses over Pro SQL Warehouses for ad-hoc queries?",
      "options": [
        "Instant startup with zero idle cost — you only pay for queries executed",
        "They are faster for all query types",
        "They support more concurrent users",
        "They have better caching"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Instant startup with zero idle cost — you only pay for queries executed",
      "explanation": "Serverless SQL Warehouses start instantly and cost nothing when idle. Pro warehouses have warm-up time and incur cost while running, but offer predictive caching for repeated dashboard queries."

      "question": "How do query parameters work in Databricks SQL dashboards?",
      "options": [
        "Users select values (dates, regions) that filter the SQL query at runtime using :param_name syntax",
        "Parameters are hardcoded in the SQL query",
        "Parameters are set once and cannot be changed",
        "Parameters only work with Python, not SQL"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Users select values (dates, regions) that filter the SQL query at runtime using :param_name syntax",
      "explanation": "Query parameters (`:date_start`, `:region`) create interactive widgets on dashboards. Users select values, and the SQL query re-executes with those values, providing self-service analytics without custom dashboards per team."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What triggers a SQL Alert notification?",
      "options": [
        "When a scheduled query returns results matching a configured condition (e.g., row count > 0)",
        "When a dashboard is viewed",
        "When a SQL Warehouse starts",
        "When any query fails"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "When a scheduled query returns results matching a configured condition (e.g., row count > 0)",
      "explanation": "SQL Alerts run a query on a schedule and evaluate a condition. If the condition is met (e.g., low inventory items exist), it sends a notification to Slack, email, or webhook."

        "A third-party BI tool",
        "A data lake file browser",
        "A monitoring dashboard for cluster metrics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Databricks-native dashboard builder that uses SQL queries as the data source for visualizations",
      "explanation": "Lakeview is the built-in Databricks dashboard experience. Every chart is backed by a SQL query, supporting parameters, auto-refresh, sharing, and embedding."

        "HAVING",
        "WHERE",
        "FILTER",
        "LIMIT"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "HAVING",
      "explanation": "Recall from SQL Analytics Intro: WHERE filters individual rows before grouping, while HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY aggregation. For example, HAVING SUM(revenue) > 10000 filters low-revenue groups."
