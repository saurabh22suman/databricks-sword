# MISSION DEBRIEF: Operation Glass Dashboard

**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## RESULTS SUMMARY

You've built NovaMart's real-time BI dashboard system on the Lakehouse:

### What You Accomplished

- **Configured SQL Warehouses** — Serverless for ad-hoc, Pro for mission-critical dashboards
- **Built Lakeview dashboards** — Interactive charts with parameters for self-service
- **Set up SQL Alerts** — Automated monitoring for KPI breaches with Slack/email notifications
- **Scheduled refreshes** — Dashboards always show fresh data without manual intervention

### Key Concepts Locked In

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| SQL Warehouse (Serverless) | Pay-per-query, instant startup, ideal for ad-hoc analytics |
| SQL Warehouse (Pro) | Dedicated compute, caching, ideal for dashboards |
| Lakeview Dashboard | Native Databricks visualization with SQL-backed charts |
| Query Parameters | Interactive filters (date range, region) without separate dashboards |
| SQL Alerts | Automated monitoring with threshold-based notifications |
| Scheduled Refresh | Auto-update dashboard data on a time-based schedule |
| Row-Level Security | UC-governed data access ensures users see only their data |

*"Our regional managers can finally see real-time inventory instead of yesterday's news. The alerts alone saved us $200K in stockout prevention last month."*
