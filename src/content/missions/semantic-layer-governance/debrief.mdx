# MISSION DEBRIEF: Operation Crystal Lens

**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## RESULTS SUMMARY

You've unified OmniGroup's analytics into a single governed semantic layer:

### What You Accomplished

- **Created data products** — Curated, documented Gold tables with discoverability in Catalog Explorer
- **Configured AI/BI Genie** — Natural language analytics with proper governance and metric context
- **Defined standard metrics** — Company-wide definitions eliminating the "three revenue numbers" problem
- **Implemented data contracts** — Schema expectations, freshness SLAs, quality guarantees
- **Set up row-level security** — Multi-tenant dashboards with dynamic filtering per business unit

### Key Concepts Locked In

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Data Product | Curated, documented, discoverable dataset with SLA commitments |
| AI/BI Genie | Natural language SQL generation using table metadata and metrics |
| Metric Layer | Standard SQL views defining company-wide business metrics |
| Data Contract | Schema, quality, and freshness guarantees for downstream consumers |
| Row-Level Security | Dynamic views filtering data based on the querying user's identity |
| Column Masking | Dynamic functions hiding sensitive columns (PII, salary) per user role |
| Catalog Explorer | Discovery interface for finding and understanding data products |
| Genie Instructions | Curated context that guides Genie's SQL generation for accuracy |

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Before:** 3 conflicting revenue definitions, SQL-only access, no data contracts
**After:** Single metric standard, natural language access, governed data products with SLAs

## BI TRACK COMPLETE

You've completed the entire BI track:
1. ✅ **SQL Analytics Intro** — SQL fundamentals on Databricks
2. ✅ **BI Dashboards** — Lakeview dashboards, alerts, and scheduled refreshes
3. ✅ **Advanced SQL Analytics** — CTEs, window functions, materialized views
4. ✅ **Semantic Layer & Governance** — Data products, Genie, RLS, contracts

You now have the skills to build enterprise-grade BI solutions on the Databricks Lakehouse.
