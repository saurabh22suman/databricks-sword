  "hints": [
    "Bronze layer stores raw data as-is",
    "Silver layer applies cleansing and standardization",
    "Gold layer contains business-level aggregates"

  "explanation": "The medallion architecture provides a logical organization for data lakes. Bronze preserves raw data for auditability. Silver applies quality rules. Gold delivers business value. This layered approach enables incremental processing and data quality enforcement.",
