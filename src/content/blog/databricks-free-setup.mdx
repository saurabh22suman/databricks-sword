# How to Set Up Databricks Free Edition for Databricks Sword

Databricks Sword works entirely in simulated mode — you never *need* a real Databricks workspace.
But if you want to run your code against a real Spark cluster, Databricks offers a **free Community Edition** that's perfect for learning.

This guide walks you through setup in under 10 minutes.

---

## What Is Databricks Community Edition?

Databricks Community Edition is a free, limited version of the full Databricks platform. It gives you:

- **A single-node Spark cluster** (driver only, no workers)
- **Notebooks** for writing PySpark, SQL, Scala, and R
- **Delta Lake** support (ACID transactions, time travel)
- **DBFS** (Databricks File System) for storing data
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking

### Limitations

- No multi-node clusters (single driver only)
- No Jobs/Workflows scheduler
- No Unity Catalog
- No SQL Warehouses
- Cluster auto-terminates after 2 hours of inactivity
- Community support only (no SLA)

For Databricks Sword missions, the Community Edition covers all B-rank and most A-rank content.
S-rank missions that require Unity Catalog or Workflows will remain in simulated mode.

## Step 1: Sign Up

1. Navigate to [community.cloud.databricks.com](https://community.cloud.databricks.com)
2. Click **Sign Up** (or **Get Started — Free**)
3. Fill in:
   - First name, last name
   - Email address (use a personal email — corporate emails may redirect to a trial)
   - Company (enter "Learning" or your actual company)
4. Check the terms of service checkbox
5. Click **Sign Up**
6. Verify your email address by clicking the link sent to your inbox

> **Tip:** If you're redirected to a 14-day trial page instead of Community Edition, look for a small link that says "Get started with Community Edition" near the bottom.

---

## Step 2: Create Your Workspace

After verifying your email:

1. You'll be prompted to choose a cloud provider — select **Community Edition** (not AWS/Azure/GCP)
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for your workspace to provision
3. You'll land on the **Databricks Workspace** home page

Your workspace URL will look like: `https://community.cloud.databricks.com`

### Explore the Interface

- **Workspace** — your notebooks and files
- **Repos** — Git integration
- **Data** — browse tables and DBFS
- **Compute** — manage your cluster
- **Machine Learning** — MLflow experiments

---

## Step 3: Start Your Cluster

Before running any code, you need an active cluster:

1. Click **Compute** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Create Cluster** (or your existing cluster if one exists)
3. Give it a name like `databricks-sword-cluster`
4. Leave all defaults (single node, latest runtime)
5. Click **Create Cluster**
6. Wait 3-5 minutes for the cluster to start (status changes from "Pending" to "Running")

> **Note:** The cluster auto-terminates after **2 hours** of inactivity. You can restart it anytime from the Compute page.

---

## Step 4: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)

To connect your Databricks workspace to Databricks Sword, you need a PAT:

1. Click your **profile icon** (top-right corner)
2. Select **Settings**
3. Navigate to **Developer** → **Access Tokens**
4. Click **Generate New Token**
5. Enter a description: `Databricks Sword`
6. Set expiration: **90 days** (or your preference)
7. Click **Generate**
8. **Copy the token immediately** — you won't be able to see it again!

Store the token somewhere safe (password manager recommended).

---

## Step 5: Connect to Databricks Sword

1. Open Databricks Sword at your deployed URL
2. Navigate to **Profile** → **Settings**
3. Find the **Databricks Connection** section
4. Enter:
   - **Workspace URL:** `https://community.cloud.databricks.com`
   - **Personal Access Token:** paste your PAT
5. Click **Verify Connection**
6. If successful, you'll see a green checkmark
7. Click **Save**

---

## Step 6: Enable Real Mode on Missions

Now that you're connected:

1. Open any mission
2. Look for the **Mode Toggle** at the top of the stage player
3. Switch from **Simulated** to **Real Databricks**
4. Your code will now execute against your real Databricks cluster

> **Important:** Not all stages support real mode. Drag-drop and quiz stages are always simulated. Code challenges (fill-blank, free-text) will execute against your workspace.

---

## What's Next?

With your workspace connected, you can:

- **Run PySpark code** against a real Spark cluster
- **Create Delta tables** and query them with time travel
- **Track MLflow experiments** in your workspace
- **Compare your results** with the simulated output

Start with a B-rank mission like **Lakehouse Fundamentals** to test your connection.

## Troubleshooting

### "PAT expired" Error

Your Personal Access Token has a set expiration date. Generate a new one:

1. Go to Settings → Developer → Access Tokens
2. Generate a new token
3. Update it in Databricks Sword Profile → Settings

### "Cluster not running" Error

Your cluster auto-terminates after 2 hours of inactivity:

1. Go to Compute in your Databricks workspace
2. Find your cluster and click **Start**
3. Wait for it to reach "Running" state
4. Retry the mission

### "Connection refused" Error

Check that:

- Your workspace URL is exactly `https://community.cloud.databricks.com`
- There are no trailing slashes
- Your PAT is correct and hasn't expired
- Your cluster is running

### "Redirected to trial" During Signup

If you keep getting redirected to the 14-day trial:

1. Try using a different email address (personal Gmail, etc.)
2. Look for "Community Edition" link at the bottom of the trial page
3. Clear your browser cookies and try again
4. Use an incognito/private window

### Cluster Takes Too Long to Start

Community Edition clusters can take 3-7 minutes to start. If it takes longer than 10 minutes:

1. Cancel the cluster creation
2. Create a new cluster
3. Try during off-peak hours (early morning or late evening UTC)

That's it! You're now ready to level up your Databricks skills with real cluster execution.
Remember — simulated mode works perfectly for all missions. Real mode is optional but recommended for the full experience.

**Happy forging!** ⚔️
