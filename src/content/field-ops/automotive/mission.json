  "description": "Connected vehicle platform needs telemetry pipeline and maintenance predictions",
  "scenario": "AutoConnect's predictive maintenance system crashed this morning. Fleet managers can't see vehicle health dashboards. Service centers are operating blind. The IoT engineer left broken timestamp parsing, incomplete anomaly detection, and empty predictive maintenance tables.",
  "situation": "The pipeline has three issues:\n1. Telemetry data has timestamp parsing errors (timezone issues)\n2. Anomaly detection thresholds are hardcoded wrong\n3. Predictive maintenance model integration is completely missing",
  "objectives": [
    "Ingest telemetry with proper UTC timestamp conversion",
    "Detect anomalies in engine temp, oil pressure, battery voltage",
    "Calculate time-to-maintenance predictions per vehicle",
    "Generate maintenance alerts for critical vehicles",
    "Pass all vehicle health validation checks"
