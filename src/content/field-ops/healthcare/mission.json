  "description": "Hospital system needs patient 360 views and FHIR-compliant data lake",
  "scenario": "HealthCare United's new EHR data lake went live last week but patient lookups are failing. Clinical teams can't access unified patient records. The data engineer who built it left incomplete code for patient deduplication, missing PII masking, and broken FHIR code standardization.",
  "situation": "The pipeline has four critical issues:\n1. EHR records have schema mismatches causing ingestion failures\n2. Patient records aren't deduplicated (same patient, multiple IDs)\n3. PII fields in patient_360 view are not masked\n4. ICD-10 and LOINC codes aren't standardized to FHIR",
  "objectives": [
    "Ingest EHR records with schema evolution handling",
    "Deduplicate patients using fuzzy matching on name+DOB",
    "Create patient_360 view with PII masking (SSN, address)",
    "Standardize ICD-10 and LOINC codes to FHIR format",
    "Pass all HIPAA compliance validation checks"
